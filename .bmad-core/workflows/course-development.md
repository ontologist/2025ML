# Course Development Workflow
## Machine Learning and Intelligence Course

### Overview
This workflow guides the systematic development of the 12-week ML course using the BMad method framework.

### Workflow Steps

#### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. **Environment Configuration**
   - [ ] Set up 2025ml conda environment
   - [ ] Install required Python libraries
   - [ ] Configure development tools (Jupyter, VS Code)
   - [ ] Set up AI tutoring bot framework

2. **Course Structure Creation**
   - [x] Create comprehensive syllabus
   - [x] Design weekly curriculum breakdown
   - [ ] Create skeleton code templates
   - [ ] Set up assessment framework

#### Phase 2: Content Development
3. **Week-by-Week Content**
   - [ ] Week 1: ML Introduction & Environment Setup
   - [ ] Week 2: Python for Data Science
   - [ ] Week 3: Data Collection & Web Scraping
   - [ ] Week 4: Data Preprocessing & EDA
   - [ ] Week 5: Supervised Learning - Classification
   - [ ] Week 6: Text Mining & Feature Extraction
   - [ ] Week 7: Model Evaluation & Selection
   - [ ] Week 8: Advanced Classification Techniques
   - [ ] Week 9: Midterm Project
   - [ ] Week 10: Final Project - Data Collection
   - [ ] Week 11: Final Project - Model Training
   - [ ] Week 12: Final Project - Evaluation & Presentation

4. **Skeleton Code Development**
   - [ ] Create fill-in-the-blank templates
   - [ ] Provide comprehensive comments
   - [ ] Include error handling examples
   - [ ] Add progress tracking

#### Phase 3: AI Integration
5. **AI Tutoring Bot**
   - [ ] Design conversational interface
   - [ ] Implement course-specific knowledge base
   - [ ] Create assessment capabilities
   - [ ] Set up 24/7 availability

6. **Assessment Framework**
   - [ ] Interactive quizzes
   - [ ] Code review capabilities
   - [ ] Progress tracking
   - [ ] Personalized feedback

#### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
7. **Quality Assurance**
   - [ ] Test all skeleton code
   - [ ] Validate AI bot responses
   - [ ] Review curriculum flow
   - [ ] Check learning objectives alignment

8. **Final Integration**
   - [ ] Complete documentation
   - [ ] Final testing
   - [ ] Deployment preparation
   - [ ] Instructor training materials

### Success Criteria
- All 12 weeks have complete content
- Skeleton code works without errors
- AI bot provides accurate assistance
- Learning objectives are clearly met
- Real-world project (mynavi.jp classifier) is achievable

### Dependencies
- Python 3.13.7 environment
- Required ML libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)
- Web scraping tools (requests, beautifulsoup4)
- AI framework for tutoring bot
- Assessment platform integration

### Timeline
- **Weeks 1-3**: Foundation and basic content
- **Weeks 4-8**: Core ML concepts and skeleton code
- **Weeks 9-10**: AI integration and testing
- **Weeks 11-12**: Final validation and deployment

### Risk Mitigation
- Regular testing of skeleton code
- Continuous AI bot training
- Student feedback incorporation
- Backup content creation
- Technical support preparation
