## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- **Create** new features from existing data
- **Transform** features to improve model performance
- **Select** most important features for classification
- **Engineer** domain-specific features for company data
- **Evaluate** feature importance and relevance

学習目標：
- 既存のデータから新しい特徴を作成する
- モデルパフォーマンスを改善するために特徴を変換する
- 分類のために最も重要な特徴を選択する
- 企業データのためにドメイン固有の特徴を設計する
- 特徴の重要性と関連性を評価する

---

## Topics Covered

### Feature Creation
- **Interaction Features**: Combining existing features
- **Polynomial Features**: Non-linear relationships
- **Binning**: Discretizing continuous variables
- **Aggregations**: Summary statistics

### Feature Transformation
- **Log Transform**: Handle skewed distributions
- **Power Transform**: Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson
- **Cyclical Encoding**: For time/date features

### Feature Selection
- **Filter Methods**: Correlation, variance threshold
- **Wrapper Methods**: RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination)
- **Embedded Methods**: L1 regularization, tree importance

### Domain-Specific Features
- Company age from founding year
- Industry categories consolidation
- Location-based features
- Text-derived features (sentiment, keywords)
