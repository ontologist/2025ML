### Learning Philosophy

**Active > Passive**
You learn by **doing**, not just listening. Lectures are short; practice is long.

**Iterative > Perfect**
Don't worry about getting everything right the first time. ML is about experimentation!

**Bot-Guided > Solo**
You're never stuck. The ML-101 Bot is available 24/7 to answer questions and guide you.

**Practical > Theoretical**
Everything connects to the real project you're building. Theory serves practice, not vice versa.

A: Yes, but you must document all usage in transparency logs (institutional policy).

**Q: How much time should I spend per week?**
A: ~2 hours total: 15-20 min lecture + 40-60 min activity + 30-40 min assignment completion.

**Q: Is the bot grading my work?**
A: Bot provides initial feedback and facilitates submission. Instructor does final grading.

**Q: What if the bot gives wrong information?**
A: Good catch! Verify important info and report issues to instructor. Bot is a tool, not infallible.

**Q: Can I work with classmates?**
A: Discuss ideas together, but submit individual work. Your examples and writing must be your own.
