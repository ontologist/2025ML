## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- **Understand** what machine learning is and how it differs from traditional programming
- **Identify** ML applications in everyday technology (Netflix, Spotify, face unlock, etc.)
- **Distinguish** between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
- **Navigate** the ML-101 Bot portal and use AI learning assistants effectively
- **Connect** ML concepts to the course project (company recommendation system)

学習目標：

## 📖 Topics Covered

### What is Machine Learning?
- **Definition**: Teaching computers to learn from data
- **ML vs Traditional Programming**: Rules + Data → Answer vs Data + Answer → Rules
- **Real-world examples**: Face unlock, Netflix recommendations, Spotify playlists, Google search

### Three Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning** (教師あり学習): Learning from labeled examples
2. **Unsupervised Learning** (教師なし学習): Finding patterns without labels
3. **Reinforcement Learning** (強化学習): Learning through trial and error

### The ML Workflow
```
1. COLLECT DATA → 2. PREPARE DATA → 3. TRAIN MODEL → 4. MAKE PREDICTIONS
```

### Course Project Preview
Build a **company recommendation system** that learns YOUR career preferences and suggests companies where you should apply!

## 🤖 ML-101 Bot Portal

**Access the ML-101 Bot**: [Bot Portal Link - To Be Provided]

**What the Bot Does**:
- ✅ Guides you step-by-step through activities
- ✅ Answers questions 24/7 in English or Japanese
- ✅ Provides feedback on your work
- ✅ Tracks your progress through the course
- ✅ Assesses understanding through conversations

**Remember**: The bot is a learning tool, not a replacement for thinking! Use it to understand concepts, not just to get answers.

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Getting Started
- **Think about your daily apps**: Social media, music, shopping, navigation
- **Ask "how" not just "what"**: Explain HOW the ML works, not just WHAT it does
- **Use the bot actively**: Don't hesitate to ask clarifying questions
- **Be specific**: Generic descriptions like "Netflix uses ML" aren't enough

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Confusing ML with traditional programming (calculators are NOT ML)
- ❌ Too brief descriptions without explaining the learning component
- ❌ Not connecting examples to the course project
- ❌ Skipping AI transparency documentation when using external chatbots

### Example of Good ML Application Description
**Application**: Spotify Discover Weekly
**Description**: Creates personalized playlists by analyzing listening history, skip patterns, and similar users' preferences. Adapts recommendations over time without explicit programming.
**Type**: Recommendation System
**Why ML?**: Learns patterns from behavior data rather than following pre-programmed rules.
